    <h3>
      From &ldquo;The New Decameron&rdquo;&mdash;Volume III.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      By D. H. Lawrence
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was thin, crisp snow on the ground, the sky was blue, the wind very
      cold, the air clear. Farmers were just turning out the cows for an hour or
      so in the midday, and the smell of cow-sheds was unendurable as I entered
      Tible. I noticed the ash-twigs up in the sky were pale and luminous,
      passing into the blue. And then I saw the peacocks. There they were in the
      road before me, three of them, and tailless, brown, speckled birds, with
      dark-blue necks and ragged crests. They stepped archly over the filigree
      snow, and their bodies moved with slow motion, like small, light,
      flat-bottomed boats. I admired them, they were curious. Then a gust of
      wind caught them, heeled them over as if they were three frail boats,
      opening their feathers like ragged sails. They hopped and skipped with
      discomfort, to get out of the draught of the wind. And then, in the lee of
      the walls, they resumed their arch, wintry motion, light and unballasted
      now their tails were gone, indifferent. They were indifferent to my
      presence. I might have touched them. They turned off to the shelter of an
      open shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed the end of the upper house, I saw a young woman just coming
      out of the back door. I had spoken to her in the summer. She recognised me
      at once, and waved to me. She was carrying a pail, wearing a white apron
      that was longer than her preposterously short skirt, and she had on the
      cotton bonnet. I took off my hat to her and was going on. But she put down
      her pail and darted with a swift, furtive movement after me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind waiting a minute?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll be out in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a slight, odd smile, and ran back. Her face was long and
      sallow and her nose rather red. But her gloomy black eyes softened
      caressively to me for a moment, with that momentary humility which makes a
      man lord of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood in the road, looking at the fluffy, dark-red young cattle that
      mooed and seemed to bark at me. They seemed happy, frisky cattle, a little
      impudent, and either determined to go back into the warm shed, or
      determined not to go back. I could not decide which.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the woman came forward again, her head rather ducked. But she
      looked up at me and smiled, with that odd, immediate intimacy, something
      witch-like and impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Shall we stand in this cart-shed&mdash;it
      will be more out of the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we stood among the shafts of the open cart-shed, that faced the road.
      Then she looked down at the ground, a little sideways, and I noticed a
      small black frown on her brows. She seemed to brood for a moment. Then she
      looked straight into my eyes, so that I blinked and wanted to turn my face
      aside. She was searching me for something and her look was too near. The
      frown was still on her keen, sallow brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you speak French?&rdquo; she asked me abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was supposed to learn it at school,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I don't know a
      word.&rdquo; She ducked her head and laughed, with a slightly ugly grimace and a
      rolling of her black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good keeping your mind full of scraps,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had turned aside her sallow, long face, and did not hear what I
      said. Suddenly again she looked at me. She was searching. And at the same
      time she smiled at me, and her eyes looked softly, darkly, with infinite
      trustful humility into mine. I was being cajoled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind reading a letter for me, in French?&rdquo; she said, her face
      immediately black and bitter-looking. She glanced at me, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a letter to my husband,&rdquo; she said, still scrutinising.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her, and didn't quite realise. She looked too far into me, my
      wits were gone. She glanced round. Then she looked at me shrewdly. She
      drew a letter from her pocket, and handed it to me. It was addressed from
      France to M. Alfred Goyte, at Tible. I took out the letter and began to
      read it, as mere words. &ldquo;Mon cher Alfred&rdquo;&mdash;it might have been a bit
      of a torn newspaper. So I followed the script: the trite phrases of a
      letter from a French-speaking girl to an Englishman. &ldquo;I think of you
      always, always. Do you think sometimes of me?&rdquo; And then I vaguely realised
      that I was reading a man's private correspondence. And yet, how could one
      consider these trivial, facile French phrases private? Nothing more trite
      and vulgar in the world than such a love-letter&mdash;no newspaper more
      obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I read with a callous heart the effusions of the Belgian damsel.
      But then I gathered my attention. For the letter went on, &ldquo;Notre cher
      petit bébé&mdash;our dear little baby was born a week ago. Almost I died,
      knowing you were far away, and perhaps forgetting the fruit of our perfect
      love. But the child comforted me. He has the smiling eyes and virile air
      of his English father. I pray to the Mother of Jesus to send me the dear
      father of my child, that I may see him with my child in his arms, and that
      we may be united in holy family love. Ah, my Alfred, can I tell you how I
      miss you, how I weep for you? My thoughts are with you always, I think of
      nothing but you, I live for nothing but you and our dear baby. If you do
      not come back to me soon, I shall die, and our child will die. But no, you
      cannot come back to me. But I can come to you. I can come to England with
      our child. If you do not wish to present me to your good mother and father
      you can meet me in some town, some city, for I shall be so frightened to
      be alone in England with my child, and no one to take care of us. Yet I
      must come to you, I must bring my child, my little Alfred, to his father,
      the big, beautiful Alfred that I love so much. Oh, write and tell me where
      I shall come. I have some money. I am not a penniless creature. I have
      money for myself and my dear baby&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I read to the end. It was signed: &ldquo;Your very happy and still more unhappy
      Elise.&rdquo; I suppose I must have been smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see it makes you laugh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Goyte, sardonically. I looked up
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a love-letter, I know that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There's too many 'Alfreds'
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One too many,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&mdash;And what does she say&mdash;Eliza? We know her name's
      Eliza, that's another thing.&rdquo; She grimaced a little, looking up at me with
      a mocking laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get this letter?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postman gave it me last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is your husband at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect him home to-night. He had an accident and hurt his leg. He's
      been abroad most of his time for this last four years. He's chauffeur to a
      gentleman who travels about in one country and another, on some sort of
      business. Married? We married? Why, six years. And I tell you I've seen
      little enough of him for four of them. But he always was a rake. He went
      through the South African War, and stopped out there for five years. I'm
      living with his father and mother. I've no home of my own now. My people
      had a big farm&mdash;over a thousand acres&mdash;in Oxfordshire. Not like
      here&mdash;no. Oh, they're very good to me, his father and mother. Oh yes,
      they couldn't be better. They think more of me than of their own
      daughters.&mdash;But it's not like being in a place of your own, is it?
      You can't <i>really</i> do as you like. No, there's only me and his father
      and mother at home. Always a chauffeur? No, he's been all sorts of things:
      was to be a farm-bailiff by rights. He's had a good education&mdash;but he
      liked the motors better.&mdash;Then he was five years in the Cape Mounted
      Police. I met him when he came back from there, and married him&mdash;more
      fool me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the peacocks came round the corner on a puff of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Joey!&rdquo; she called, and one of the birds came forward, on delicate
      legs. Its grey spreckled back was very elegant, it rolled its full,
      dark-blue neck as it moved to her. She crouched down. &ldquo;Joey dear,&rdquo; she
      said, in an odd, saturnine caressive voice: &ldquo;you're bound to find me,
      aren't you?&rdquo; She put her face downward, and the bird rolled his neck,
      almost touching her face with his beak, as if kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She twisted her face up at me with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he loves me, Joey does&rdquo;&mdash;then, to the bird&mdash;&ldquo;and
      I love Joey, don't I? I <i>do</i> love Joey.&rdquo; And she smoothed his
      feathers for a moment. Then she rose, saying: &ldquo;He's an affectionate bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at the roll of her &ldquo;bir-rrd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, he is,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;He came with me from my home seven years
      ago. Those others are his descendants&mdash;but they're not like Joey&mdash;<i>are
      they, dee-urr?</i>&rdquo; Her voice rose at the end with a witch-like cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she forgot the birds in the cart-shed, and turned to business again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you read that letter?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Read it, so that I know what it
      says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's rather behind his back,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind him,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;He's been behind my back long enough. If
      he never did no worse things behind my back than I do behind his, he
      wouldn't have cause to grumble. You read me what it says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I felt a distinct reluctance to do as she bid, and yet I began&mdash;&ldquo;'My
      dear Alfred.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed that much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Eliza's dear Alfred.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;How
      do you say it in French? <i>Eliza?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her, and she repeated the name with great contempt&mdash;<i>Elise</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You're not reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I began&mdash;&ldquo;'I have been thinking of you sometimes&mdash;have you
      been thinking of me?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of several others as well, beside her, I'll wager,&rdquo; said Mrs. Goyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; said I, and continued. &ldquo;'A dear little baby was born here
      a week ago. Ah, can I tell you my feelings when I take my darling little
      brother into my arms&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet it's <i>his</i>,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Goyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It's her mother's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you believe it,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It's a blind. You mark, it's her own
      right enough&mdash;and his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It's her mother's. 'He has sweet smiling eyes, but not like
      your beautiful English eyes&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly struck her hand on her skirt with a wild motion, and bent
      down, doubled with laughter. Then she rose and covered her face with her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm forced to laugh at the beautiful English eyes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't his eyes beautiful?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;<i>very!</i> Go on!&mdash;<i>Joey dear, dee-urr Joey!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;this
      to the peacock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Er&mdash;'We miss you very much. We all miss you. We wish you were
      here to see the darling baby. Ah, Alfred, how happy we were when you
      stayed with us. We all loved you so much. My mother will call the baby
      Alfred so that we shall never forget you&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it's his right enough,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Goyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It's the mother's. Er&mdash;'My mother is very well. My
      father came home yesterday&mdash;from Lille. He is delighted with his son,
      my little brother, and wishes to have him named after you, because you
      were so good to us all in that terrible time, which I shall never forget.
      I must weep now when I think of it. Well, you are far away in England, and
      perhaps I shall never see you again. How did you find your dear mother and
      father? I am so happy that your leg is better, and that you can nearly
      walk&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he find his dear <i>wife!</i>&rdquo; cried Mrs. Goyte. &ldquo;He never told
      her that he had one. Think of taking the poor girl in like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We are so pleased when you write to us. Yet now you are in England you
      will forget the family you served so well&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bit too well&mdash;<i>eh, Joey!</i>&rdquo; cried the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If it had not been for you we should not be alive now, to grieve and to
      rejoice in this life, that is so hard for us. But we have recovered some
      of our losses, and no longer feel the burden of poverty. The little Alfred
      is a great comforter to me. I hold him to my breast and think of the big,
      good Alfred, and I weep to think that those times of suffering were
      perhaps the times of a great happiness that is gone for ever.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but isn't it a shame to take a poor girl in like that!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Goyte. &ldquo;Never to let on that he was married, and raise her hopes&mdash;I
      call it beastly, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You know how anxious women are to fall in love,
      wife or no wife. How could he help it, if she was determined to fall in
      love with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could have helped it if he'd wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We aren't all heroes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but that's different!&mdash;The big, good Alfred!&mdash;did you ever
      hear such Tommy-rot in your life?&mdash;Go on&mdash;what does she say at
      the end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;' We shall be pleased to hear of your life in England. We all
      send many kind regards to your good parents. I wish you all happiness for
      your future days. Your very affectionate and ever-grateful Elise.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, during which Mrs. Goyte remained with her
      head dropped, sinister and abstracted. Suddenly she lifted her face, and
      her eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I call it beastly, I call it mean, to take a girl in like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Probably he hasn't taken her in at all. Do you think those
      French girls are such poor innocent things? I guess she's a great deal
      more downy than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's one of the biggest fools that ever walked,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's his child right enough,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;if you prefer to think that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other reason has she for writing like that&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went out into the road and looked at the cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this driving the cows?&rdquo; I said. She too came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the boy from the next farm,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;those Belgian girls! You never know where their
      letters will end.&mdash;And after all, it's his affair&mdash;you needn't
      bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; she cried, with rough scorn&mdash;&ldquo;it's not <i>me</i>
      that bothers. But it's the nasty meanness of it. Me writing him such
      loving letters&rdquo;&mdash;she put her hands before her face and laughed
      malevolently&mdash;&ldquo;and sending him nice little cakes and bits I thought
      he'd fancy all the time. You bet he fed that gurrl on my things&mdash;I
      know he did. It's just like him.&mdash;I'll bet they laughed together over
      my letters. I'll bet anything they did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He'd burn your letters for fear they'd give him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a black look on her yellow face. Suddenly a voice was heard
      calling. She poked her head out of the shed, and answered coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Then, turning to me: &ldquo;That's his mother looking after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed into my face, witch-like, and we turned down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke, the morning after this episode, I found the house darkened
      with deep, soft snow, which had blown against the large west windows,
      covering them with a screen. I went outside, and saw the valley all white
      and ghastly below me, the trees beneath black and thin looking like wire,
      the rock-faces dark between the glistening shroud, and the sky above
      sombre, heavy, yellowish-dark, much too heavy for the world below of
      hollow bluey whiteness figured with black. I felt I was in a valley of the
      dead. And I sensed I was a prisoner, for the snow was everywhere deep, and
      drifted in places. So all the morning I remained indoors, looking up the
      drive at the shrubs so heavily plumed with snow, at the gateposts raised
      high with a foot or more of extra whiteness. Or I looked down into the
      white-and-black valley, that was utterly motionless and beyond life, a
      hollow sarcophagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing stirred the whole day&mdash;no plume fell off the shrubs, the
      valley was as abstracted as a grove of death. I looked over at the tiny,
      half-buried farms away on the bare uplands beyond the valley hollow, and I
      thought of Tible in the snow, of the black, witch-like little Mrs. Goyte.
      And the snow seemed to lay me bare to influences I wanted to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the faint glow of half-clear light that came about four o'clock in the
      afternoon, I was roused to see a motion in the snow away below, near where
      the thorn-trees stood very black and dwarfed, like a little savage group,
      in the dismal white. I watched closely. Yes, there was a flapping and a
      struggle&mdash;a big bird, it must be, labouring in the snow. I wondered.
      Our biggest birds, in the valley, were the large hawks that often hung
      flickering opposite my windows, level with me, but high above some prey on
      the steep valley-side. This was much too big for a hawk&mdash;too big for
      any known bird. I searched in my mind for the largest English wild birds&mdash;geese,
      buzzards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still it laboured and strove, then was still, a dark spot, then struggled
      again. I went out of the house and down the steep slope, at risk of
      breaking my leg between the rocks. I knew the ground so well&mdash;and yet
      I got well shaken before I drew near the thorn-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was a bird. It was Joey. It was the grey-brown peacock with a blue
      neck. He was snow-wet and spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joey&mdash;Joey de-urr!&rdquo; I said, staggering unevenly towards him. He
      looked so pathetic, rowing and struggling in the snow, too spent to rise,
      his blue neck stretching out and lying sometimes on the snow, his eyes
      closing and opening quickly, his crest all battered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joey dee-urr! Dee-urr!&rdquo; I said caressingly to him. And at last he lay
      still, blinking, in the surged and furrowed snow, whilst I came near and
      touched him, stroked him, gathered him under my arm. He stretched his
      long, wetted neck away from me as I held him, none the less he was quiet
      in my arm, too tired, perhaps, to struggle. Still he held his poor,
      crested head away from me, and seemed sometimes to droop, to wilt, as if
      he might suddenly die.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not so heavy as I expected, yet it was a struggle to get up to the
      house with him again. We set him down, not too near the fire, and gently
      wiped him with cloths. He submitted, only now and then stretched his soft
      neck away from us, avoiding us helplessly. Then we set warm food by him. I
      put it to his beak, tried to make him eat. But he ignored it. He seemed to
      be ignorant of what we were doing, recoiled inside himself inexplicably.
      So we put him in a basket with cloths, and left him crouching oblivious.
      His food we put near him. The blinds were drawn, the house was warm, it
      was night. Sometimes he stirred, but mostly he huddled still, leaning his
      queer crested head on one side. He touched no food, and took no heed of
      sounds or movements. We talked of brandy or stimulants. But I realised we
      had best leave him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night, however, we heard him thumping about. I got up anxiously
      with a candle. He had eaten some food, and scattered more, making a mess.
      And he was perched on the back of a heavy arm-chair. So I concluded he was
      recovered, or recovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was clear, and the snow had frozen, so I decided to carry him
      back to Tible. He consented, after various flappings, to sit in a big
      fish-bag with his battered head peeping out with wild uneasiness. And so I
      set off with him, slithering down into the valley, making good progress
      down in the pale shadows beside the rushing waters, then climbing
      painfully up the arrested white valley-side, plumed with clusters of young
      pine-trees, into the paler white radiance of the snowy upper regions,
      where the wind cut fine. Joey seemed to watch all the time with wide,
      anxious, unseeing eyes, brilliant and inscrutable. As I drew near to Tible
      township, he stirred violently in the bag, though I do not know if he had
      recognised the place. Then, as I came to the sheds, he looked sharply from
      side to side, and stretched his neck out long. I was a little afraid of
      him. He gave a loud, vehement yell, opening his sinister beak, and I stood
      still, looking at him as he struggled in the bag, shaken myself by his
      struggles, yet not thinking to release him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Goyte came darting past the end of the house, her head sticking
      forward in sharp scrutiny. She saw me, and came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got Joey?&rdquo; she cried sharply, as if I were a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the bag, and he flopped out, flapping as if he hated the touch of
      the snow, now. She gathered him up and put her lips to his beak. She was
      flushed and handsome, her eyes bright, her hair slack, thick, but more
      witch-like than ever. She did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been followed by a grey-haired woman with a round, rather sallow
      face and a slightly hostile bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you bring him with you, then?&rdquo; she asked sharply. I answered that I
      had rescued him the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the background slowly approached a slender man with a grey moustache
      and large patches on his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got 'im back 'gain, Ah see,&rdquo; he said to his daughter-in-law. His
      wife explained how I had found Joey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; went on the grey man. &ldquo;It wor our Alfred scarred him off, back your
      life. He must 'a' flyed ower t' valley. Tha ma' thank thy stars as 'e wor
      fun, Maggie. 'E'd a bin froze. They a bit nesh, you know,&rdquo; he concluded to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;This isn't their country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isna,&rdquo; replied Mr. Goyte. He spoke very slowly and deliberately,
      quietly, as if the soft pedal were always down in his voice. He looked at
      his daughter-in-law as she crouched, flushed and dark, before the peacock,
      which would lay its long blue neck for a moment along her lap. In spite of
      his grey moustache and thin grey hair, the elderly man had a face young
      and almost delicate, like a young man's. His blue eyes twinkled with some
      inscrutable source of pleasure, his skin was fine and tender, his nose
      delicately arched. His grey hair being slightly ruffled, he had a
      debonnair look, as of a youth who is in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mun tell 'im it's come,&rdquo; he said slowly, and turning he called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred&mdash;Alfred! Wheer's ter gotten to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned again to the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, then, Maggie, lass, get up wi' thee. Tha ma'es too much o' th'
      bod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A young man approached, limping, wearing a thick short coat and
      knee-breeches. He was Danish-looking, broad at the loins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I's come back, then,&rdquo; said the father to the son&mdash;&ldquo;leastwise, he's
      bin browt back, flyed ower the Griff Low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son looked at me. He had a devil-may-care bearing, his cap on one
      side, his hands stuck in the front pockets of his breeches. But he said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you come in a minute, Master?&rdquo; said the elderly woman, to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, come in an' ha'e a cup o' tea or summat. You'll do wi' summat,
      carryin' that bod. Come on, Maggie wench, let's go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we went indoors, into the rather stuffy, overcrowded living-room, that
      was too cosy and too warm. The son followed last, standing in the doorway.
      The father talked to me. Maggie put out the tea-cups. The mother went into
      the dairy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha'lt rouse thysen up a bit again now, Maggie,&rdquo; the father-in-law said&mdash;and
      then to me: &ldquo;'Er's not bin very bright sin' Alfred come whoam, an' the bod
      flyed awee. 'E come whoam a Wednesday night, Alfred did. But ay, you
      knowed, didna yer. Ay, 'e comed 'a Wednesday&mdash;an' I reckon there wor
      a bit of a to-do between 'em, worn't there, Maggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twinkled maliciously to his daughter-in-law, who was flushed brilliant
      and handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, be quiet, father. You're wound up, by the sound of you,&rdquo; she said to
      him, as if crossly. But she could never be cross with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Er's got 'er colour back this mornin',&rdquo; continued the father-in-law
      slowly. &ldquo;It's bin heavy weather wi' 'er this last two days. Ay&mdash;'er's
      bin north-east sin 'er seed you a Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, do stop talking. You'd wear the leg off an iron pot. I can't
      think where you've found your tongue, all of a sudden,&rdquo; said Maggie, with
      caressive sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah've found it wheer I lost it. Aren't goin' ter come in an' sit thee
      down, Alfred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred turned and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'E's got th' monkey on 'is back, ower this letter job,&rdquo; said the father
      secretly to me. &ldquo;Mother 'er knows nowt about it. Lot o' tomfoolery, isn't
      it? Ay! What's good o' makin' a peck o' trouble ower what's far enough
      off, an' ned niver come no nigher. No&mdash;not a smite o' use. That's
      what I tell 'er. 'Er should ta'e no notice on't. Ay, what can y'expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother came in again, and the talk became general. Maggie flashed her
      eyes at me from time to time, complacent and satisfied, moving among the
      men. I paid her little compliments, which she did not seem to hear. She
      attended to me with a kind of sinister, witch-like gracious-ness, her dark
      head ducked between her shoulders, at once humble and powerful. She was
      happy as a child attending to her father-in-law and to me. But there was
      something ominous between her eyebrows, as if a dark moth were settled
      there&mdash;and something ominous in her bent, hulking bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on a low stool by the fire, near her father-in-law. Her head was
      dropped, she seemed in a state of abstraction. From time to time she would
      suddenly recover, and look up at us, laughing and chatting. Then she would
      forget again. Yet in her hulked black forgetting she seemed very near to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door having been opened, the peacock came slowly in, prancing calmly.
      He went near to her, and crouched down, coiling his blue neck. She glanced
      at him, but almost as if she did not observe him. The bird sat silent,
      seeming to sleep, and the woman also sat huddled and silent, seeming
      oblivious. Then once more there was a heavy step, and Alfred entered. He
      looked at his wife, and he looked at the peacock crouching by her. He
      stood large in the doorway, his hands stuck in front of him, in his
      breeches pockets. Nobody spoke. He turned on his heel and went out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose also to go. Maggie started as if coming to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you go?&rdquo; she asked, rising and coming near to me, standing in front
      of me, twisting her head sideways and looking up at me. &ldquo;Can't you stop a
      bit longer? We can all be cosy to-day, there's nothing to do outdoors.&rdquo;
       And she laughed, showing her teeth oddly. She had a long chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I must go. The peacock uncoiled and coiled again his long blue neck
      as he lay on the hearth. Maggie still stood close in front of me, so that
      I was acutely aware of my waistcoat buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you'll come again, won't you? Do come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to tea one day&mdash;yes, do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised&mdash;one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I was out of her presence I ceased utterly to exist for her&mdash;as
      utterly as I ceased to exist for Joey. With her curious abstractedness she
      forgot me again immediately. I knew it as I left her. Yet she seemed
      almost in physical contact with me while I was with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was all pallid again, yellowish. When I went out there was no sun;
      the snow was blue and cold. I hurried away down the hill, musing on
      Maggie. The road made a loop down the sharp face of the slope. As I went
      crunching over the laborious snow I became aware of a figure striding
      awkwardly down the steep scarp to intercept me. It was a man with his
      hands in front of him, half stuck in his breeches pockets, and his
      shoulders square&mdash;a real knock-about fellow. Alfred, of course. He
      waited for me by the stone fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said as I came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came to a halt in front of him and looked into his sullen blue eyes. He
      had a certain odd haughtiness on his brows. But his blue eyes stared
      insolently at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about a letter&mdash;in French&mdash;that my wife
      opened&mdash;a letter of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;She asked me to read it to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked square at me. He did not know exactly how to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was there in it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She makes out she's burnt it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without showing it you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded slightly. He seemed to be meditating as to what line of action
      he should take. He wanted to know the contents of the letter: he must
      know: and therefore he must ask me, for evidently his wife had taunted
      him. At the same time, no doubt, he would like to wreak untold vengeance
      on my unfortunate person. So he eyed me, and I eyed him, and neither of us
      spoke. He did not want to repeat his request to me. And yet I only looked
      at him, and considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he threw back his head and glanced down the valley. Then he
      changed his position and he looked at me more confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She burnt the blasted thing before I saw it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered slowly, &ldquo;she doesn't know herself what was in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to watch me narrowly. I grinned to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't like to read her out what there was in it,&rdquo; I continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly flushed out so that the veins in his neck stood out, and he
      stirred again uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Belgian girl said her baby had been born a week ago, and that they
      were going to call it Alfred,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met my eyes. I was grinning. He began to grin, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck to her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best of luck,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you tell <i>her</i>?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the baby belonged to the old mother&mdash;that it was brother to
      your girl, who was writing to you as a friend of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood smiling, with the long, subtle malice of a farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did she take it in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as she took anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood grinning fixedly. Then he broke into a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for <i>her</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed cryptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he laughed aloud once more, evidently feeling he had won a big
      move in his contest with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the other woman?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&rdquo;&mdash;he shifted uneasily&mdash;&ldquo;she was all right&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be getting back to her,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me. Then he made a grimace with his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Back your life it's a plant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think the <i>cher petit bébé</i> is a little Alfred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only might?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;an' there's lots of mites in a pound of cheese.&rdquo; He laughed
      boisterously but uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say, exactly?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to repeat, as well as I could, the phrases of the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon cher Alfred,&mdash;Figure-toi comme je suis désolée&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened with some confusion. When I had finished all I could remember,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know how to pitch you out a letter, those Belgian lasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practice,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They get plenty,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've never got that letter, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew fine and keen, in the sunshine, across the snow. I blew my
      nose and prepared to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>she</i> doesn't know anything?&rdquo; he continued, jerking his head up
      the hill in the direction of Tible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows nothing but what I've said&mdash;that is, if she really burnt
      the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she burnt it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for spite. She's a little devil, she
      is. But I shall have it out with her.&rdquo; His jaw was stubborn and sullen.
      Then suddenly he turned to me with a new note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why didn't you wring that b&mdash;&mdash; peacock's neck&mdash;that
      b&mdash;&mdash;Joey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the brute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I let fly at him the night I got back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. He stood and mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little Elise,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she small&mdash;petite?&rdquo; I asked. He jerked up his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Rather tall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taller than your wife, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
